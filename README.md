# CODESOFT_NUMBERGAME
A random number is generated within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the user is prompted to guess it. Feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low is provided until the correct number is guessed, with a limit on the number of attempts and an option to play multiple rounds.
